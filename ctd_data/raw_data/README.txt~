Written 5/15/2013 even though this data has been mostly collected for over two years. 

This folder contains more or less the CTD data from the period surrounding the 2011 tsunami in Pescadero. 

018517_20110316_1810.hex (and .mat) looks to be a bench test the morning after fieldwork.  
081517_20110314_1409.hex and/or 018517_20110314_1532_2.hex are probably a profile from March 14, 2011.  I don't know if there is profile CTD data from March 10, 2011. 


Upstream: 
17295, 9620, 10364 (probably colocated with 9783), 17294 (after 3/14/11).

Downstream:
17296, 17293

Thermistors in the lagoon were: 
19920, 21, 22, 23, 27, 28, 29. Some of those were probably on the US mooring. Some were on a separate "thermistor" moorning with pressure sensor 9783.
